          <!-- A brief description of myself as a fantasy football player -->

        <p>I have been playing fantasy football for more than two decades now. <br>
          Most of that time has been spent playing the season long version of the game. <br>
          Going forward, most of my hobby time and energy will be spent playing daily fantasy football instead.
