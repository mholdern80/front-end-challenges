  <p>I have been playing fantasy football for more than two decades now. <br>
    Most of that time has been spent playing the season long version of the game. <br>
    Going forward, most of my hobby time and energy will be spent playing daily fantasy football instead.
  </p>

  <h2>Strengths</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Not a fish</em></li>
    <li>Understand what's sticky</li>
    <li>Good at projecting player ownership</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>1 x DK Showdown Winner</strong></li>
    <li>Multiple cash game contest wins</li>
    <li>Multiple h2h contest wins</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Unfortunately, my recent large pool contest win was a tie with 390 others.</p>
