  <h1>Matthew Holderness</h1>
  <p></p>
  <p>I have been playing fantasy football for more than two decades now. 
    Most of that time has been spent playing the season long version of the game. 
    Going forward, most of my hobby time and energy will be spent playing daily fantasy football instead.
  </p>
  <h2>Strengths</h2>
  <ul>Not a fish</ul>
  <ul>Understand trends</ul>
  <ul>Good at projecting player ownership</ul>
  <h2>Eperience</h2>
  <ol>1 X DK Showdown Winner</ol>
  <ol>Multiple cash game contest wins</ol>
  <ol>Multiple h2h contest wins</ol>
  <p>Unfortunately, my recent large pool contest win was a tie with 390 others.</p>
